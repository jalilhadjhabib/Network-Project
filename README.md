# Network Project - CESI EXIA 2nd Year

This GitHub repository houses the work conducted during my second year of Computer Science studies at CESI EXIA School as part of a networking project.

## Project Context

The project was based on a fictitious case study where Tomas Vergis, the CEO of Vergis Corporation, wished to overhaul his company's network architecture and security following a strategic information theft. My team and I were tasked with proposing a model for the new IT infrastructure and network security.

Our responsibilities included:

- Defining an architecture that meets the client's needs.
- Selecting the appropriate hardware.
- Establishing a quote for this hardware.
- Configuring the equipment.
- Realizing a functional model.
- Presenting our work to the MOA team during the project's final meeting.

At the end of the project, each floor of all buildings was equipped with IT hardware, and all workstations were connected to the wired network of Vergis Corporation. The network was designed so that all services (support, infrastructure, development) were allowed to exchange throughout the entire company network, while other users had limited access.

## Repository Content

This repository includes:

- Network topology.
- Addressing table.
- Network model.
- Hardware quote.
- Routing configuration.
- Server configuration.
- Security configuration.
- WiFi folder.
- Final project report.

This project was an exciting challenge that not only tested my technical skills but also allowed me to develop my teamwork, project management, and presentation skills. I hope this work will be helpful for anyone looking to understand how to approach a network project in a professional context.
